# grid_of_life
A self-study project aiming to replicate Conway's Game of Life in a simple 3D-World written in C++, using OpenGL for rendering.

The aim of this project is to have a hands-on project to learn C++. To keep it interesting, we learn OpenGL alongside to always have something interesting to render/draw. We chose a simple emulation 
of the well-known Game of Life in a 3D World instead of a 2D-Grid. 

We implemented the simulation and added a simple UI for controlling it in the application using the Dear-ImGui library. We also have simple camera movement.
